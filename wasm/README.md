# Roll Goal - Using Web Assembly

The project has been built inside of the `dist` folder. You need to run it at the root of a server to open it (needed to load WebAssembly, because blocked by CORS otherwise).

If you want to build the project yourself, you need to install [EmScripten](https://emscripten.org/index.html) compiler to build C++ to WebAssembly.
