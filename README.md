# Roll Goal

A small game where you have to move a ball across each levels without ever touching the ground. Based on the [mini-game](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Rollgoal) in The legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess.

It has been made across multiple game engines :

Engine | Status
--- | ---
Unity | Gameplay works but to improve
Unreal Engine | Template base
Godot | Basic gameplay
SDL2 (Using OpenGL ES3 and ECS architecture) | Just started
